# Python Projects

This repository contains Python projects I have created.

## Move Files
I used Tkinter and Python to create a console application to move files from one repository to another. The user is prompted to select source and destination directories. If the user decides to proceed with moving the text files in the source directory, the file is moved and the name of the file and a timestamp are stored in the SQLite3 database 

## Check Directory
I created a simple program to check a directory for a file and prints the lastest date created/modified to the console if the file has been found.

## Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
Inspired by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla's variation of Rock Paper Scissors, I decided to create a console application based on the rules of this much beloved game. Users play against the computer and can choose to play a limitless number of rounds. They are also able to view the rules of the game if they are uncertain of them or forget. Because user input is requested at multiple points, user input errors had to be handled to ensure that the program would not break. In future, I hope to add a score keeping feature and possibly more games for users to choose from.
