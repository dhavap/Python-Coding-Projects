# Python-Projects

This repository contains Python projects I have created.

## Move Files
I used Tkinter and Python to create a console application to move files from one repository to another. The user is prompted to select source and destination directories. If the user decides to proceed with moving the text files in the source directory, the file is moved and the name of the file and a timestamp are stored in the SQLite3 database 

## Check Directory
I created a simple program to check a directory for a file and prints the lastest date created/modified to the console if the file has been found.
