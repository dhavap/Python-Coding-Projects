# Python-Coding-Projects
The Tech Academy Python coding projects

This repository contains the Python projects I did as a student of the Software Development Bootcamp at The Tech Academy. I made a console application to move files from one repository to another. I learned to use Tkinter. I also used sqlite for one of the assignments.
